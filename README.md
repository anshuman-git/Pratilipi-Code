# Pratilipi-Code

The PHP files with numbers on them (1.php, 2.php, etc) are the story links.

The index.php is the homepage code.

All other files do what their names suggest, i.e., the login is for login, the registration is for signup, etc.

The working URL- https://anshuman-pratilipi.000webhostapp.com/

There is also a zip file with the name Pratilipi.zip. That is there in case some error occurs, in that situation you can just extract that file and you will have access to all the files in the repository.
